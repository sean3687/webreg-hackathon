### 2023 UCI Webreg Hackathon

The UCI University Registrar has hired a consulting company to help them update WebRegâ€™s interface. The ANTrepreneur Center is partnering with the Registrar to help them with customer discovery so that current UCI students can offer high-value feedback on the current website and course registration process. Through our WebReg Hackathon, the University Registrar will be able to gather ideas from students for their new interface.

### What Our Team Do

- Go to the Customer Discovery section to find problems with the current registration system.
